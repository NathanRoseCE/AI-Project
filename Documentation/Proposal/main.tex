\title{AI Poker}

\section{Problem Statement}
The goal of the project is to train an AI to be very good at poker(Texas Holdem \cite{TexasHoldEm}),
in order to do this a poker game will be created. This game will allow human vs AI(for testing) and AI vs AI(
for training). In order to simplify the training, the game will only feature 5 players.

\section{Proposed Approach}
In order to train the model, the system will be forced to play against itself in order to improve its skills,
this unsupervised with reinforcement learning approach is used as the system does not have labeled correct
plays, due to hidden information. One possible method of training could be NEAT\cite{NEAT} where neurons are
added in between generations. The AI will be rewarded based on gaining the most money overe a set number of rounds.

To train the AI will be given information about its hand, the cards currently available, the pot ammount, and
each player's bet ammount. It will be evaluated based off the money the AI has after 10 rounds.

\section{Team Structure}
We are using AGILE SCRUM to assign tasks to maintain flexibility over time. Issues will be tracked on github and
we will make sure we are logging who closed issues for end evalution.
